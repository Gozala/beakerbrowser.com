The Web platform is more than just a single browser: it’s a set of standards that have seen wide adoption. Standards are at the core of the Web platform’s strength. By having all browsers share the Web platform, users are guaranteed freedom of choice.

Beaker is an experiment. It is designed to demonstrate the features that we believe the Web platform should adopt. Our goal is not to create a “new Web,” but rather to influence the Web we have. We don’t want to replace the existing browsers; we want to change them.

By participating in Beaker, you help give a voice to our experiment.

#### Motivations

We’re afraid of the Web losing its spirit of freedom and innovation.

Private ownership of Web software disempowers users. It enables businesses to decide how people can interact, what they see, and where they go. It forces the world to depend on businesses to solve pressing social issues -- or not.

We believe software that is “by the people” is thus the voice “of the people.” When computing is private, its control should be personal; when computing is social, it is a political system and should derive its authority from a democratic process. Social computing should not exist as a service offered by businesses; it should be the natural result of a network of computers, just as human society is the natural result of cooperating communities.

We also believe that the economic future of small and independent creators is at stake. Given the high costs of commercial egress network bandwidth, it’s vital to independent content-creators that a peer-to-peer network contributes bandwidth for popular content. Otherwise the cost of hosting can exceed the economic value of the content, and third-parties such as YouTube and Vimeo will always be required to subsidize distribution.
