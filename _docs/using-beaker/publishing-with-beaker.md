## Adding and publishing files

Once you’ve created a site, you can start adding files to its source folder.

## Sharing your site

Share the URL with friends, and keep Beaker online, so that your friends can download the site. The URL for Dat  archives are unguessable, and your files can only be seen by people you share the URL with.
