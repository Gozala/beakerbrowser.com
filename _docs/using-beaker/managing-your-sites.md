## The staging area

Any time you add, delete, or change your site’s files, you can review your changes before you publish them. If you make a mistake, just revert your changes!

## Unpublished changes

Prior to publishing, you can open your site to preview the unpublished changes. Until your changes are published, only you will see the changes.
