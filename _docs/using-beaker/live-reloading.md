It can be helpful during development to have the browser automatically reload the page when files are changed. Beaker offers this feature through the dropdown menu next to the address bar.

Navigate to the site, click the dropdown menu in the top right, then click “Turn on live reloading.” You'll see a lightning symbol in the URL bar. Now, any time you make a change, the site will auto-refresh.
