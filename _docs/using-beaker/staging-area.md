Every site you create or save has a folder. This is called the “staging area.”

You can review the state of the staging area in the library. Any time you add, delete, or modify the files in your site’s folder, that change will be tracked. From there, you can publish or revert the changes.

## Unpublished changes

Prior to publishing, you can open your site to preview the unpublished changes. Until your changes are published, only you will see the changes.
