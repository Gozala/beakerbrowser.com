## Saving a site to your Library

If you want to keep a site you visit, simply save it to your Library. This will store a read-only version of the site, which will automatically update as the owner makes changes.

## Forking a site

If you want to create an editable copy of a site you visit, you can "fork" the site. Forking creates a new, editable duplicate of the site in your library. You will own the new site, and have the ability to publish changes to it.

Forked sites are given an entirely new URL, which you control.
