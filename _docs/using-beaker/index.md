Peer-to-peer websites are just like any other website. But instead of being served from a datacenter, files are hosted by peers on your network. This makes it easy for anybody to host a site.

You can see how many peers are hosting a site’s files. When you navigate to a site, you’ll automatically share the files you download for a short period.
