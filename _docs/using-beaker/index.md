## What is a peer-to-peer Web site?

Peer-to-peer sites are just like any other Web site. But instead of being served from a datacenter, files are hosted by peers on your network. This makes it easy for anybody to host a site.

## Browsing the peer-to-peer network

You can see how many peers are hosting the site’s files. When you navigate to a site, you’ll automatically share the files you download for a short period.
