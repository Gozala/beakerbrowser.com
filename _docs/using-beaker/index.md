Beaker is a new kind of browser that gives you the power to create websites,
share files, and control your data. It's an evolving reimagination of the Web,
and we're excited to have you on the journey with us. Welcome!

## A peer-to-peer Web

At the heart of Beaker is a **peer-to-peer network** for sharing all kinds of
content.

It lets you skip the middle man and share data directly with your
friends and colleagues. P2P is fantastic for sharing information privately, and
it works great for publishing to a broad audience too!

## Using Beaker

### Share personal files

Create a site, add the files, and send the URL using a chat program. It's
encrypted from end-to-end so that you have total privacy.

### Make webpages

Create a site, fill it with your
HTML/CSS/JS, and publish the URL (eg on Twitter). Your users can save the sites
permanently, so that they work offline. [You can host in the
cloud too.](/docs/tutorials/host-outside-of-beaker.html)

### Hack on P2P apps

Create a site, then build your app
using the [new Web APIs in Beaker](/docs/apis/). Every app is hostless, and
ships with forkable source code.

### Browse the Web

Of course, Beaker works great as a regular Web browser too. It's built using
Chromium, the Free and Open Source engine from Google Chrome.

## How to create a site

If you want to share files, make webpages, or hack on apps, you'll need to
create a site.

## Adding files to a site

You can add files to a site by opening the folder in your explorer, then
copying the files into the directory.

<figure>
  <img class="screenshot" src="/img/docs/tour-new-site-publish1.png"/>
  <figcaption class="thick">Click "Open folder"</figcaption>
</figure>

## Import files button

You can also use the "Import files" button to add files.

<figure>
  <img class="screenshot" src="/img/docs/tour-import-files1.jpg"/>
  <figcaption class="thick">Click "Import files"</figcaption>
</figure>

</section>

<section markdown="1">

## Publish changes

When you're ready to share the files, click "Publish."

Even if somebody has the URL of your site, they won't be able to access the
files until you "publish" them. That's so you can review your changes first.

## How to share a site

When you're ready to share, you just need to copy and paste the URL.

<figure>
  <img class="screenshot" src="/img/docs/tour-share-site1.png"/>
  <figcaption class="thick">Click "Share site"</figcaption>
</figure>

## How to manage your site

Beaker keeps all the sites you create in the "Library." You can find a link to
it in your main menu.

<figure>
  <img class="screenshot" src="/img/docs/tour-library1.jpg"/>
  <figcaption class="thick">Click "Library" in the browser dropdown menu</figcaption>

## Using the sidebar

If you're visiting a peer-to-peer site, you can quickly access more information
by using the sidebar control.

## Live reloading

As the author of a site, or just as a remote recipient, live-reloading makes it
easy to stay abreast of changes while you work. Turn it on to have the page
automatically update every time you make a change.

## Sync for offline

As the visitor to a site, you may want to save a site for offline reading.
Turn on "Sync for offline" to make sure you get the latest updates when online,
and then can access the files when offline.

## Forking a site

Sometimes, you want to create a new copy of a site that you control. This is
called "Forking" the site, and it's very convenient in Beaker.
