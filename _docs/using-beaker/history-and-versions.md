## Viewing a site’s history

Every addition, deletion, and modification to your site is added to your site’s history log. You can review every change in the "History" section in your Library.

## Site versions

Each revision made to a site creates a new version of the site. You can view any version of a site by adding `+\${versionNumber}` to the end of the domain.
