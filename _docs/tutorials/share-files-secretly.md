One of Beaker’s most powerful features comes from the Dat protocol’s approach to transport secrecy. As explained in [Inside Beaker: Privacy and security](/docs/inside-beaker/privacy-and-security.html#transport-security), a Dat URL is “secret.” It is unguessable, and encrypted over the wire. This means:

**Only users that possess a Dat URL can access its files.**

To share files secretly, [create a new Dat](/docs/using-beaker/create-a-site.html) and use a private channel to send the URL to your intended recipients.

After transferring the files, remove the Dat from your library. Removing a Dat doesn’t delete your local copy of the files; it just removes the archive from your Beaker, so that nobody else can download the site.
