We let the schedule slip a week, because this release is SO GOOD that we had to build the suspense.
Here it is!

## Command line tool: bkr

You can now command Beaker from the CLI with [bkr](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/7947).

This tool is super handy for developing and publishing sites on dat, so check it out.

## Archive History View

@poga implemented a very handy history view on archives:

## Updated Dat Web API

We simplified the Dat API.The serve() and unserve() methods are now gone, and the complicated (internal) claims system has been replaced.
We also added binary and timeout support to the APIs.

## Changes
- 💻   Command line tool: bkr
- 🕐  Archive history view
- 🔩  Reliability improvements to the Dat network
