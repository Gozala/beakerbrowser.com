With the 0.4.x series, we begin work on Dat applications, starting with the `dat` Web API. We'll continue to add new APIs and application support over the coming months.

## Changes
- Add `dat` API with two new methods, [dat.readFile](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat.html#dat-readfile) and [dat.readDirectory](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat.html#dat-readdirectory)
- Dat directories without an index.html will now render a simple file-listing, instead of redirecting to the dat-viewer. Users can manually redirect using the navbar tools.

## Fixes:
- Fixed a crash-condition in dev tools for dat sites https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/149
- Relaxed security policy to: HTTPS sites can now show images served over HTTP, but still can't embed executable assets https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/94
- Updated Electron to enable dat-protocol features, without bypassing CSPs https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues/115
