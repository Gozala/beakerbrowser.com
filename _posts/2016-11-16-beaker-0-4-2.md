Not much to see here. You probably shouldn't bother updating.

_SIKE!_ We've got some great updates in this release. It'll really help take your mind off your post-election blues.

## Reworked Dat Management and Viewing

We gave the builtin Dat pages a total makeover.

## API for Dat sites to request Network Access

We updated the `navigator.permissions` API to include support for requesting network access. Now a Dat site can request permission to break the network sandbox:

``` js
navigator.permissions.request({ name: 'network', hostname: 'github.com' }).then(res => {
  if (res.status === 'granted') window.location.reload() // have to reload to take effect
})
```
