title: Beaker v0.5.1
---

Ok, for real this time, this is the Beaker release you can ignore. It's mostly bugfixes and API tweaks. It's really not that interesting.

## Changes
- 👎  Added `bkr open` command, and `bkr dev` now automatically opens the temporary site it created. (#214)
- ❓ Some new default bookmarks, including the [r/hashsites](https://www.reddit.com/r/hashsites/) community (#213)
- 💩  IPFS hash URLs are now tolerant of leading or trailing slashes (#212)
- 💀  Added new dat api aliases: dat.createSite(), dat.deleteSite(), dat.listFiles(), and dat.exists()
