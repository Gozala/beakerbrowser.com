In [Beaker 0.7.2](/2017/06/05/beaker-0-7-2.html), we made policy updates that enable an application model we call "Self-mutating websites." In this post, I'll explain what they are and how to get the most out of them.

## What are self-mutating websites?

Self-mutating websites are [Dat](/docs/inside-beaker/dat-files-protocol.html) websites that can modify their own files.

When you first visit a self-mutating website, it's in read-only mode. In order to make changes,
you'd need to [fork the site](/docs/using-beaker/forking-sites.html) to make an editable copy. Then your
forked copy will be able to write changes to itself.

</figure>

In the example above, the site writes to its own `index.html` to persist its changes.

## How do self-mutating websites work?

Self-mutating websites are [Dat websites](/docs/using-beaker/the-peer-to-peer-web.html) that use the [`DatArchive` Web API](/docs/apis/dat.html) to modify their own files. These modifications can include anything from storing user data to modifying the application's own code.

Self-mutation is a very convenient way to do personal storage and publishing, e.g., on a Wiki or TODO list. For example, a self-mutating TODO application would write the user's data to its own archive files, which would then be stored on the user's device.

## How can I build a self-mutating site?

The fastest way to get started is to [view the source of this example application in Beaker](dat://6ef097c861c8c1857aefa9b2e9700d3061955d4552c492ab1e3f69ca77fdcba7) or [fork it](/docs/using-beaker/forking-sites.html) to create your own editable copy. This app includes everything you need to know about building a self-mutating website.
