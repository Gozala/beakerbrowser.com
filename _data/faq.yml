  question: "Will my files be available when I’m offline?"
  answer:
    "<p>It depends. When you turn off your computer, <em>you</em> are no longer
     hosting your files. But if you’ve shared the URL to your site with others,
     it’s possible that they might be hosting its files.</p>"

  question: "How do I view a specific version of a site?"
  answer:
    "<p>Beaker's peer-to-peer websites are versioned. To view a site at a previous
    version, simply add <code>+{versionNumber}</code> to the end of the site’s domain.</p>"
-
  question: "Who can see websites I publish with Beaker?"
  answer:
    "<p>Your site is private by default. Dat URLs are effectively unguessable and
     are never sent over the network, so only people you share the URL with will
     be able to download your site’s files.</p>"

  question: "Is my site’s traffic encrypted?"
  answer:
    "Yes. Your site’s traffic is encrypted in transit using its URL/public key.
     So to decrypt the traffic, one must know the site’s URL."
