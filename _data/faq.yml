  question: "Will my files be available when I’m offline?"
  answer:
    "<p>It depends. When you turn off your computer, <em>you</em> are no longer
     hosting your files. But if you’ve shared the URL to your site with others,
     it’s possible that they might be hosting its files.</p><p>To
     guarantee that your site’s files are available even when you’re offline,
     you can use a cloud rehosting service like <a href=\"https://hashbase.io\">
     Hashbase</a>.</p>"

  question: "How is Dat different than IPFS?"
  answer:
    "<p>Both IPFS and Dat deduplicate content-addressed pieces of data and
     provide a mechanism for searching for peers who have a specific piece of
     data.</p><p>Unlike IPFS, Dat archives are addressed by a public key
     instead of a static hash. This makes it possible for Dat archives to
     to be editable, with the added bonus that Dat maintains a verifiable
     record of every addition, deletion, and modification to an archive.</p>"

  question: "Who can see Web sites I publish with Beaker?"
  answer:
    "<p>Your site is private by default. Dat URLs are effectively unguessable and
     are never sent over the network, so only people you share the URL with will
     be able to download your site’s files.</p>"
