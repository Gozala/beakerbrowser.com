    "<p>Beaker enables <em>truly secret file sharing</em>. Files published with
     the Dat protocol are secret by default — only people who know the site’s
     URL can decrypt and download its files.</p><p>When you share a URL,
     your recipient can download its files directly from your
     computer. No third-party service required.</p><p><a href=\"/docs/inside-beaker/privacy-and-security.html\">Learn more <i class=\"fa fa-angle-right\"></i></a></p>"
